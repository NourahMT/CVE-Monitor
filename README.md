# CVE-Monitor
This project is built to keep track of latest critical CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) changes provided by NVD and show it in an easy way that is suitable for monitoring screens. The server checks for any updates periodically and updates the clients automatically.

## To do:
- Refresh the client page when the server version/code is updated (to reflect new changes).
- Make the age of the CVE configurable (now it is set to 24 hours inside the code)
- Do we need to show the data in a more flexible table which allows the user to sort, search, export ...etc, maybe something like PrimeUI DataTable (https://www.primefaces.org/primeui/#datatableFilter)

## Deployment
- See INSTALLATION.md

### Built With:

- Flask - web framework for python
- Python 3.6

## Authors:
- Nourah Altawallah - Initial work and enhancements
- Fahad Alduraibi - Idea, support and enhancements
