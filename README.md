- Have a server configuration file for all variables (e.g. proxy settings, time intervals, URLs ...).
- - The repo should provide a sample file "config.txt.sample" and the user need to create a config file based on the sample.
- - Running the server without a valid config file should show a warning in the webpage>
- Document how to run the server under apache or nginx with a wsgi module.
